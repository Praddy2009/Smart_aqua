# SmartAqua

SmartAqua is an IoT based project made to automate the watering process of plants. We all know how important it is to water plants to enable them survive longer but now it become very difficult due to various reasons. So, to automate the process we have created an IoT based project which will check the moisture level of soil and we can querry the same over internet using telegram bot.
